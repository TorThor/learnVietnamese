# learnVietnamese

This is a personal project to help me learn Vietnamese and React Native for the first time by having pronounciation resources at my fingertips (Android and iOS). I found there weren't any readily available resources like this, so I decided to make my own study tool.

I might later down the road, but for now (02/08/2024), I will not be properly documenting this project nor with my git pushes.

## How to Use

If you wish to use or see this for yourself:

1. Clone the project on a computer
2. Run `npx expo start --tunnel` to start and host the app (may need to config ngrok if prompted)
3. Download the Expo Go app on desired device (Android or iOS)
4. Access the app on any network by scanning the QR code given in the terminal using your phone (you can take a picture of the QR code and use an app to open QR codes from your photo library for later reference)
